"The Clean Hydrogen Ladder (now up to v4.1)" could be a single interactive SVG.
I mentioned this in a reply to https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/clean-hydrogen-ladder-v40-michael-liebreich/

and Michael Liebrich provided a link to the presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zDt5TxqacweNLh_tY1KwHXT4VW-CNnSL/edit#slide=id.p3

From the slide master this is "Clean Hydrogen Use Case Ladder â€“ Version 4.1a" of 9 September 2021 by @mliebreich

BUG: fonts look weird in Google Docs, and doesn't render right.

Download the pptx, open in LibreOffice Impress. Looks good.

Copy C:\Windows\Fonts\Arial, put the main arial.ttf file in ~/.fonts

Slide 3 is the key.
So Export as SVG. No option to choose a slide (!!?),

To get the Liebrich badge and footer text to appear I had to edit the SVG to comment out the opening and closing defs tag around the Slide Master components, and then deleted the `<script>` tag.
I filed Inkscape bug https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/-/issues/6566

TODO: In a browser with JS disabled (easiest to do in Konqueror), the items in the ladder layer of the edited SVG don't appear. I could go through and remove all the 'visibility: "hidden"' attributes, or set them to 'visibility: "visible"'. But maybe if I reverted to an earlier version, fixed the visibility of class="SlideGroup", then ungrouped in Inkscape, I would fix it once and for all. 

TODO: so make this interactive, add a legend for
* Chemicals & processes
* Aviation & shipping
* etc.
that when rolled over fills in the appropriate rects

TODO: note Terms & Conditions on last slide #11.

TODO: need to add a LICENSE with CC-BY 3.0 (different because it's not my copyright?)
TODO: Need to change T&C text in SVG to add "as modified by skierpage."

TODO: need to embed Arial (? or rely on fc-match). Supposedly https://vecta.io/nano will do this, according to their own https://vecta.io/blog/how-to-use-fonts-in-svg . Or could try to do it ourselves , see https://lvngd.com/blog/how-embed-google-font-svg/
