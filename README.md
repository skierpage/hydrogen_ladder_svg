== TODO: Categories legend and highlight ==
TODO: so make this interactive

TODO: add a legend for
* Chemicals & processes
* Power system
* Aviation & shipping
* Land transportation
* Heating
that when rolled over fills in the appropriate rects
??? Where to fit this in?

So give each rounded-rectangle instance a class
chemicals-processes (I don't think '+' is legal in CSS class)
power_system
aviation-shipping
land_transportation
heating

And on rollover of each one,
 * add style category-highlighted to everything with the same class, e.g. chemicals-processes

I don't think I can use :hover CSS pseudoselector to change everything that shares the class,
it only affects what you're hovering over.

Then have CSS saying for style category-highlighted
* In category_legend, style the text of the item with that class bold
* In each row, style the fill color of every item with that class to match the row.
  - TODO: this would be easiest if they were within a group with class .rowA_items
  - for now I have an explicit "rowA", "rowB", etc. clss on several of the items.
  - TODO: it's actually the path within the item with the class, i.e. .rowA > .path
  - this is sort-of wrong since there are two paths in each rounded rect item.
  - TODO: this is probably easier if every item in the row is within a group with ID "row-A", "row-B", etc.
- TODO: rename "row" -> something less geometric like...??? "level" "suitability", or "rating"

TODO: decide whether to leap to Inkscape version
	* adds id for everything
	* > in style block becomes &gt;
	* nearly every attribute indented 2 spaces
    * all colors change from rgb to hex, e.g.  stroke="rgb(118,84,163)" ->   stroke="#7654a3"
  - TODO: find an XML differ that can handle or reformat its attribute whitespace
    git diff --ignore-space-change is pretty good
  - maybe have one commit where I edit in Inkscape and save but no other changes
    - then ungroup and remove mask
    - then organize each rows items into a groupchange

TODO: the original SVG has two paths for each rounded rect, one setting the fill and one setting the stroke. Why not just one path that sets both?
TODO: check if Impress exports a rounded rect with separate fill and stroke paths.
BUG: is this a PPTX import bug or a bug in how Impress exports a rounded rect with a fill and stroke?

TODO: instead of a function adding an onmouseenter handler, actually add one to each item.
TODO: see if Inkscape leaves this alone or even presents it as an object property.


==== Category/arrow colors for each row of the ladder ====
When highlighting items in a category like "chemicals & processes", the items take the same fill color as the arrow for that row.

The CSS colors for each row/rating https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp to convert these colors to rgb()
A: #1fa550
B: #54b149 rgb(84, 177, 73)
C: #bcd033
D: #f5e925
E: #f9b61f
F: #ef7127
G: #e61a26

=== TODO: set cursor on hover items (?) ===
could add cursor="pointer" to them.


== TODO: Competing Technologies legend and highlight ==
TODO: Copy from Slide #9 (hydrogen_ladder_competing_technologies.svg) the grouping:
"Key:
* No real alternative
* Electricity/batteries
* Biomass/biogas
* Other
with grouping "competing_legend"
Probably change "Key" to "Competing Technologies"
And each g inside here has a class
* alternative-none, alternative-elec_battery, alternative-biomass_biogas, alternative_other and alternative-ammonia
Add these classes to every g id

upon rollover of the competing_legend group (anywhere), change items with these classes to add style "competing-highlight", which is a nested selector to make some items green border, etc.
and 
=== TODO: get rounded rect stroke and fill colors for these from slide #9
=== TODO: asterisk reveal in competition ? ===
Also the trick of within "Biomass/biogas", the items 'Shipping", Long-haul aviation, Vintage vehicles, and "Medium-haul aviation" all get an asterisk and the slide shows the footnote.
     * Most likely via ammonia or e-fuel rather than H2 gas or liquid.

== TODO: Arial font ==
TODO: need to embed Arial (? or rely on fc-match). Supposedly https://vecta.io/nano will do this, according to their own https://vecta.io/blog/how-to-use-fonts-in-svg . Or could try to do it ourselves , see https://lvngd.com/blog/how-embed-google-font-svg/


== TODO: Terms and conditions ==
TODO: note Terms & Conditions on last slide #11.

TODO: I could add a (c) symbol that pops this up.

TODO: need to add a LICENSE with CC-BY 3.0 to project (different because it's not my copyright?)
TODO: should I change T&C text in SVG to add "as modified by skierpage."

== Bugs ==
TODO: BUG: If I import the SVG back into LibreOffice (Impress opens), the underlined text in the T&C doesn't appear (check with the original export)
TODO: BUG: If I insert the SVG into a LibreOffice Draw document, only the master slide graphics appear, not the stuff on the slide (check with the original export)

TODO: BUG: LibreOffice SVG export fails validation
hydrogen_uses_ladder.svg is valid XML, but 
https://validator.w3.org/check complains

*  Error Line 21, Column 133: end tag for "font-face" which is not finished 
   <font-face font-family="Arial embedded" units-per-em="2048" font-weight="normal" font-style="normal" ascent="1852" descent="423"/>
This suggests it wants to have some child element.

== Cleanup ==
The main content is nestead g1234 > g1232 > container-id1 > id1 (which has a clip path) > g1228. Could remove most or all of these.

Remove all the ooo: attributes

Remove the <defs> section that names slide elements and is out-of-date and probably useless.

== DONE: Summary so far ==
"The Clean Hydrogen Ladder (now up to v4.1)" could be a single interactive SVG.
I mentioned this in a reply to https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/clean-hydrogen-ladder-v40-michael-liebreich/
and Michael Liebrich provided a link to the presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zDt5TxqacweNLh_tY1KwHXT4VW-CNnSL/edit#slide=id.p3

From the slide master this is "Clean Hydrogen Use Case Ladder â€“ Version 4.1a" of 9 September 2021 by @mliebreich

BUG: fonts look weird in Google Docs, and doesn't render right.

Download the pptx, open in LibreOffice Impress. Looks good.

Copy C:\Windows\Fonts\Arial, put the main arial.ttf file in ~/.fonts

Slide 3 is the key.
So Export as SVG. No option to choose a slide (!!?),

TODO: In a browser with JS disabled (easiest to do in Konqueror), the items in the ladder layer of the edited SVG don't appear. I could go through and remove all the 'visibility: "hidden"' attributes, or set them to 'visibility: "visible"'. But maybe if I reverted to an earlier version, fixed the visibility of class="SlideGroup", then ungrouped in Inkscape, I would fix it once and for all. 
^^^^ did I do this?

== Cleanup ==
Removed overall group
Removed dummy-master-page group for class Master_Slide and its Background and BackgroundObjects
Removed bg-id2 class Background (filled with white, but it seems white anyway).
Kept bo-id ("BackgroundObjects" group

Saved this iteration of hydrogen_uses_ladder.svg

Next in Inkscape only: remove g1232 group (ungroup?), remove (ungroup) container-id1, then release object id1 from its clip_path (in the file as #presenataion_clip_path).
The clip_path became black rect3002 (not present before) which I deleted.

Now I'm down to g id1 class "Slide", a group of 1. ungroup that to give g id "g1228" class "Page", ooo:name "Clean_Hydrogen_Ladder"
Ungroup that and I have all the items on the slide.

Select the top row of rects, group them, give the group the ID "g_rowA".

later removed the dummy-slide and dummy-master-page groups

=== Fixed the LibreOffice export ===
To get the Liebrich badge and footer text to appear I had to edit the SVG to comment out the opening and closing defs tag around the Slide Master components, and then deleted the `<script>` tag.
I filed Inkscape bug https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/-/issues/6566
