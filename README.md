"The Clean Hydrogen Ladder (now up to v4.1)" could be a single interactive SVG.
I mentioned this in a reply to https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/clean-hydrogen-ladder-v40-michael-liebreich/

and Michael Liebrich provided a link to the presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zDt5TxqacweNLh_tY1KwHXT4VW-CNnSL/edit#slide=id.p3

BUG: fonts look weird in Google Docs, and doesn't render right.

Download the pptx, open in LibreOffice Impress. Looks good.

Copy C:\Windows\Fonts\Arial, put the main arial.ttf file in ~/.fonts

Slide 3 is the key.
So Export as SVG. No option to choose a slide (!!?),

TODO: so make this interactive, add a legend for
* Chemicals & processes
* Aviation & shipping
* etc.
that when rolled over fills in the appropriate rects

TODO: note Terms & Conditions on last slide #11.

TODO: need to embed Arial (? or rely on fc-match). Supposedly https://vecta.io/nano will do this, according to their own https://vecta.io/blog/how-to-use-fonts-in-svg . Or could try to do it ourselves , see https://lvngd.com/blog/how-embed-google-font-svg/
